## Substrate-etl Queries:
You can generate the above summary data using the following queries using the public dataset `substrate-etl` in Google BigQuery:


### Blocks 

[Schema](https://github.com/colorfulnotion/substrate-etl/blob/main/schema/blocks.json)

```bash
SELECT date(block_time) as logDT, MIN(number) startBN, MAX(number) endBN, COUNT(*) numBlocks 
 FROM `substrate-etl.polkadot.blocks2046`  
 where LAST_DAY(date(block_time)) = "2023-04-30" 
 group by logDT 
 order by logDT
```

### Signed Extrinsics
