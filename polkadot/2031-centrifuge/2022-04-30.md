## Substrate-etl Queries:
You can generate the above summary data using the following queries using the public dataset `substrate-etl` in Google BigQuery:

### Blocks
```bash
SELECT date(block_time) as logDT, MIN(number) startBN, MAX(number) endBN, COUNT(*) numBlocks 
 FROM `substrate-etl.polkadot.blocks2031`  
 where LAST_DAY(date(block_time)) = "2022-04-30" 
 group by logDT 
 order by logDT
```

### Signed Extrinsics
```bash
SELECT date(block_time) as logDT, 
COUNT(*) numSignedExtrinsics 
FROM `substrate-etl.polkadot.extrinsics2031`  
where signed and LAST_DAY(date(block_time)) = "2022-04-30" 
group by logDT 
order by logDT
```

### Active Accounts
```bash
SELECT date(ts) as logDT, 
 COUNT(*) numActiveAccounts 
 FROM `substrate-etl.polkadot.accountsactive2031` 
 where LAST_DAY(date(ts)) = "2022-04-30" 
 group by logDT 
 order by logDT
```

### Passive Accounts
```bash
SELECT date(ts) as logDT, 
 COUNT(*) numPassiveAccounts 
 FROM `substrate-etl.polkadot.accountspassive2031` 
 where LAST_DAY(date(ts)) = "2022-04-30" 
 group by logDT 
 order by logDT
```

### New Accounts
```bash
SELECT date(ts) as logDT, 
 COUNT(*) numNewAccounts 
 FROM `substrate-etl.polkadot.accountsnew2031` 
 where LAST_DAY(date(ts)) = "2022-04-30" 
 group by logDT
 order by logDT
```

### Addresses with Balances
```bash
SELECT date(ts) as logDT,
 COUNT(distinct address_pubkey) numAddress 
 FROM `substrate-etl.polkadot.balances2031` 
 where LAST_DAY(date(ts)) = "2022-04-30" 
 group by logDT 
 order by logDT
```

### Events
```bash
SELECT date(block_time) as logDT, 
 COUNT(*) numEvents 
 FROM `substrate-etl.polkadot.events2031` 
 where LAST_DAY(date(block_time)) = "2022-04-30" 
 group by logDT 
 order by logDT
```

### Transfers:
```bash
SELECT date(block_time) as logDT, 
 COUNT(*) numEvents 
 FROM `substrate-etl.polkadot.transfers2031` 
 where LAST_DAY(date(block_time)) = "2022-04-30" 
 group by logDT 
 order by logDT
```

### XCM Transfers In:
```bash
SELECT date(origination_ts) as logDT, 
 COUNT(*) numXCMTransfersIn 
 FROM `substrate-etl.polkadot.xcmtransfers` 
 where origination_para_id = 2031 and LAST_DAY(date(origination_ts)) = "2022-04-30" 
 group by logDT 
order by logDT
```

### XCM Transfers Out:
```bash
SELECT date(origination_ts) as logDT, 
 COUNT(*) numXCMTransfersOut 
 FROM `substrate-etl.polkadot.xcmtransfers` 
 where destination_para_id = 2031 and LAST_DAY(date(origination_ts)) = "2022-04-30" 
 group by logDT order by logDT
```
