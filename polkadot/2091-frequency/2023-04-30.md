```bash
SELECT date(block_time) as logDT, MIN(number) startBN, MAX(number) endBN, COUNT(*) numBlocks 
 FROM `substrate-etl.polkadot.blocks2091`  
 where LAST_DAY(date(block_time)) = "2023-04-30" 
 group by logDT 
 order by logDT
```

### Signed Extrinsics 

[Schema](https://github.com/colorfulnotion/substrate-etl/blob/main/schema/extrinsics.json)

```bash
SELECT date(block_time) as logDT,
