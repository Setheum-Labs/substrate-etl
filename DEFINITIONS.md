# Substrate-etl Definitions

_Note: These are tentative, and may be revised based on community feedback._

To support precise transparent definitions of all data summarized within substrate-etl report summaries (and used in polkaholic.io)
(see [All metrics are imperfect, but many are useful. Letâ€™s make them more available](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/all-metrics-are-imperfect-but-many-are-useful-lets-make-them-more-available/1858/4)),
we attempt to define terms used in this repo both in English and through BigQuery on the substrate-etl datasets.

The open source approach taken here is of _transparency_ and _reproducibility_: with exact BigQuery computations, anyone can reproduce any datapoint and improve any definition with adjustments to query form.  

## Account Metrics (Substrate)

* _Active Accounts_ (Substrate): Accounts that have signed an extrinsic on a Substrate chain 
* _System Accounts_ (Substrate): Accounts that have participated in consensus and produced a block
* _Passive Accounts_ (Substrate): Accounts that aren't active but have any balance changes for any asset (native or non-native asset, within chain or cross-chain). This can include proxy and multisig accounts, remote execution triggered by other accounts, transfer recipients (including crowdloan and staking rewards distribution), and balance deductions (e.g., pre-authorized transferFrom/proxy called by other active accounts).

The above definitions are mechanized in `substrate-etl` BigQuery below.  The following computes _Active Accounts_, _System Accounts_ and _Passive Accounts_ for the Kusama relay chain for February 1, 2023 using the following public data:

* `substrate-etl.kusama.extrinsics0`
* `substrate-etl.kusama.blocks0`
* `substrate-etl.kusama.transfers0`

The counts of each are shown in the report summaries.  To compose for
any other chain or date, simply replace `0` with a paraID (e.g. `2023`
for [Moonriver](/kusama/2023-moonriver)), adjust the relay chain from `kusama` to `polkadot`
if appropriate, and the date `2023-02-01` with another date in the
queries below.
