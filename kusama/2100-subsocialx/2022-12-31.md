## Substrate-etl Queries:
You can generate the above summary data using the following queries using the public dataset `substrate-etl` in Google BigQuery:


### Blocks
```
SELECT date(block_time) as logDT, MIN(number) startBN, MAX(number) endBN, COUNT(*) numBlocks FROM `substrate-etl.kusama.blocks2100`  where LAST_DAY(date(block_time)) = "2022-12-31" group by logDT order by logDT
```


### Signed Extrinsics
```
SELECT date(block_time) as logDT, COUNT(*) numSignedExtrinsics FROM `substrate-etl.kusama.extrinsics2100`  where signed and LAST_DAY(date(block_time)) = "2022-12-31" group by logDT order by logDT
```


### Active Accounts
```
SELECT date(block_time) as logDT, COUNT(distinct signer_pub_key) numAccountsActive FROM `substrate-etl.kusama.extrinsics2100` where signed and LAST_DAY(date(block_time)) = "2022-12-31" group by logDT order by logDT
```


### Addresses:
```
SELECT date(ts) as logDT, COUNT(distinct address_pubkey) numAddress FROM `substrate-etl.polkadot.balances2100` where LAST_DAY(date(ts)) = "2022-12-31" group by logDT
```
