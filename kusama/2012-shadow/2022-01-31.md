## Substrate-etl Queries:
You can generate the above summary data using the following queries using the public dataset `substrate-etl` in Google BigQuery:


### Blocks
```
SELECT date(block_time) as logDT, MIN(number) startBN, MAX(number) endBN, COUNT(*) numBlocks FROM `substrate-etl.kusama.blocks2012`  where LAST_DAY(date(block_time)) = "2022-01-31" group by logDT order by logDT
```


### Signed Extrinsics
```
SELECT date(block_time) as logDT, COUNT(*) numSignedExtrinsics FROM `substrate-etl.kusama.extrinsics2012`  where signed and LAST_DAY(date(block_time)) = "2022-01-31" group by logDT order by logDT
```


### Active Accounts
```
SELECT date(ts) as logDT, COUNT(*) numActiveAccounts FROM `substrate-etl.kusama.accountsactive2012` where LAST_DAY(date(ts)) = "2022-01-31" group by logDT order by logDT
```


### Passive Accounts
```
SELECT date(ts) as logDT, COUNT(*) numPassiveAccounts FROM `substrate-etl.kusama.accountspassive2012` where LAST_DAY(date(ts)) = "2022-01-31" group by logDT order by logDT
```


### New Accounts
```
SELECT date(ts) as logDT, COUNT(*) numNewAccounts FROM `substrate-etl.kusama.accountsnew2012` where LAST_DAY(date(ts)) = "2022-01-31" group by logDT order by logDT
```


### Addresses with Balances:
```
SELECT date(ts) as logDT, COUNT(distinct address_pubkey) numAddress FROM `substrate-etl.polkadot.balances2012` where LAST_DAY(date(ts)) = "2022-01-31" group by logDT order by logDT
```


### Events:
```
SELECT date(block_time) as logDT, COUNT(*) numEvents FROM `substrate-etl.kusama.events2012` where LAST_DAY(date(block_time)) = "2022-01-31" group by logDT order by logDT
```


### Transfers:
```
SELECT date(block_time) as logDT, COUNT(*) numEvents FROM `substrate-etl.kusama.transfers2012` where LAST_DAY(date(block_time)) = "2022-01-31" group by logDT order by logDT
```


### XCM Transfers In:
```
SELECT date(origination_ts) as logDT, COUNT(*) numXCMTransfersIn FROM `substrate-etl.kusama.xcmtransfers` where origination_para_id = 2012 and LAST_DAY(date(origination_ts)) = "2022-01-31" group by logDT order by logDT
```


### XCM Transfers Out:
```
SELECT date(origination_ts) as logDT, COUNT(*) numXCMTransfersOut FROM `substrate-etl.kusama.xcmtransfers` where destination_para_id = 2012 and LAST_DAY(date(origination_ts)) = "2022-01-31" group by logDT order by logDT
```
